# PowerShell Module: ApiManagementModule

## Overview

The `ApiManagementModule` PowerShell module provides comprehensive functionalities for managing interactions with APIs, including authentication, data retrieval, updates, and error handling. It includes a robust retry mechanism with exponential backoff to handle transient errors and network issues effectively. This module is designed to be flexible and easily integrated into various API-dependent workflows.

Key features include:
- **Authentication**: Supports authentication methods like Bearer tokens and basic authentication.
- **API Requests**: Provides functions for making GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests to API endpoints.
- **Error Handling**: Handles HTTP status codes, network errors, and API-specific errors with informative messages and retry logic.
- **Configuration**: Allows configuration of retry attempts, delay times, and API endpoints through parameters or configuration files.
- **Logging**: Includes optional logging functionality to capture errors and diagnostic information.

## Setup

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - PowerShell version 5.1 or later installed on your system.
   - Internet access to interact with the targeted API endpoints.

2. **Installation**:
   - Clone or download the `ApiManagementModule` repository to your local environment.

3. **Configuration**:
   - Customize the configuration files (`config.json`, `Utils.ps1`) to set API endpoints, retry settings, and logging preferences as needed.

4. **Dependencies**:
   - Ensure required PowerShell modules (`Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility`) are installed and up to date.

## Usage

1. **Importing the Module**:
   - Open PowerShell and import the module using `Import-Module ApiManagementModule`.

2. **Example Usage**:
   ```powershell
   # Authenticate with API and obtain token
   $token = Get-ApiToken -url "https://api.example.com/token" -clientId "client_id" -clientSecret "client_secret"

   # GET request example
   $response = Invoke-ApiGetRequest -url "https://api.example.com/data" -token $token
   Write-Output $response

   # POST request example
   $body = @{
       "name" = "New Data"
       "value" = "123"
   }
   $postResponse = Invoke-ApiPostRequest -url "https://api.example.com/data" -token $token -body $body
   Write-Output $postResponse
   ```

3. **Advanced Usage**:
   - Customize retry attempts and delay times:
     ```powershell
     Set-RetrySettings -maxAttempts 5 -initialDelay 1 -maxDelay 32
     ```

   - Integrate with specific API endpoints:
     ```powershell
     # Example: Update user profile
     $profileData = @{
         "firstName" = "John"
         "lastName" = "Doe"
     }
     $updateResult = Invoke-ApiPutRequest -url "https://api.example.com/profile" -token $token -body $profileData
     Write-Output $updateResult
     ```

4. **Expected Output**:
   - Successful API requests will return data or confirmation messages.
   - Errors are handled gracefully with retry attempts as per configured settings.
   - Logs capture error details for diagnostic purposes.

## Error Handling

- **HTTP Status Codes**: Handles common status codes (`200`, `401`, `422`, etc.) with descriptive error messages.
- **Network Errors**: Detects and retries on network timeouts, connection resets, and other transient issues.
- **API-Specific Errors**: Parses API-specific error responses and provides actionable error messages.

## Additional Notes

- **Customization**: Extend module functionalities with additional API methods (`Invoke-ApiPutRequest`, `Invoke-ApiDeleteRequest`) or integrate with new API endpoints.
- **Security**: Securely manage credentials and tokens using environment variables or secure storage methods.
- **Logging**: Utilize logging functions (`Log-Error`) for detailed error tracking and troubleshooting.
